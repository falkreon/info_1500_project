# Final Project for Info 1500 Web Development

Final project for an introductory web dev course, by someone who is bored to tears by introductory webdev courses.


This is a basic html + css course, and I'm following very specific guidance on what to do and use. If you're wondering why I made a particular choice, that's probably why. If you're wondering why I didn't use a hamburger menu, in spite of the specific guidance to use a hamburger menu on small screen sizes, please see the included paper, ["Hamburger Menus are Bad UX"](file:///home/falkreon/Documents/Class/info1500_webdev/hamburger_menus_are_bad.pdf), and read as many of the cited sources as you need to in order to understand.
