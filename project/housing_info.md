# Security Deposit<

The security deposit is $300.00 USD and will be refunded after the dwelling 
has been vacated and any charges for damages have been paid in full.
	
# Inspections

There are six types of inspections, and you will be provided at least 24-hour 
notice of an inspection:

- <b>Move in</b> – A move-in inspection is performed by the tenant at the time the lease is signed. This is to report any damages at the apartment that need to be noted on the form and work orders will be made to make repairs.
	
- <b>Welcome Visit</b> – This inspection is conducted after two months of occupancy. Its purpose is to check if you have any problems or questions.
	
- <b>Annual Inspection</b> – A required inspection where staff perform a “walk-through” inspection checking for health or safety issues, physical condition, and housekeeping of the unit. (The tenant should be present, but do not need to be present.)
	
- <b>Special Inspection</b> – Performed when it is determined that a housekeeping or other problem exists and is not being corrected.
	
- <b>HUD Inspections</b> – Are randomly conducted at the HUD’s request. The inspector randomly selects units to physically inspect. A notice will be sent to all tenants prior to this inspection.
	
- <b>Move-Out</b> – This inspection will be conducted when you move-out. After the inspection is completed, staff will discuss any damages and charges to you.


# Automobiles and Parking

There are NO assigned parking places. Everyone should be considerate of their neighbor’s
needs. You are allowed 1 vehicle per licensed driver in the lot.


# Renter's Insurance

The Cairo Housing Authority is not responsible for the replacement of personal property in the units.
It is suggested that each tenant have renter’s insurance for this purpose.


# Utilities

Utilities such as telephone, internet, and cable tv are the tenant’s choice and they are 
responsible for payment.


# Weather Emergency

If there is a tornado warning, take shelter in your shower.  Close the bathroom door and cover
yourself with a blanket.  It is recommended that you take a radio and flashlight with you. During electrical 
storms it is recommended you unplug your computer.


# Guests

You can have guests and visitors.  HOWEVER, you may not allow others who are not on your lease to live 
in or stay in your unit for more than 14 days each year without prior approval of the Landlord.


# Bed Bugs and Other infestations

Report any type of vermin infestation, bed bugs, mice, roaches, etc. 
Infestations can occur even if a unit is being kept clean. If there is an infestation, it is important that they 
are reported immediately to stop the spread of the infestation.


# Smoke Alarms

If your smoke alarm goes off DO NOT try to remove it from the ceiling.  Open your door and windows and it will eventually shut off on its own.  These are hard wired and do not have a reset button.


# Community Service

The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 require that all non-exempt public housing adult residents (18 or older) contribute eight (8) hours per month of community service (volunteer work).  This is a requirement of the Public Housing Lease. A copy of a sample letter explaining the conditions for exemption can be found on the Resources webpage.


# Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy

Additional policies and procedures for the Housing Authority are included in the Cairo Housing Authority’s Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy (ACOP).  The ACOP defines the Cairo Housing Authority’s policies for operation for the Public Housing Program, incorporating Federal, State and Local law.


A copy of the ACOP is available in the Housing Authority office.  Tenants are encouraged to read the ACOP. Tenants may check out a copy of the ACOP from the Executive Director and must be returned within a 24-hour period.
